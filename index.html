      <p>My name is Diana Chávez and I'm an international student at Fanshawe College. I'm originally from El Salvador (Central America) and came to Canada last year to study a postgraduate in Interactive Media. </p>
      <p>I have a degree in Social Media and Journalism, and I have several years of working experience in different areas. I speak fluently three languages (and trying to at least learn one more), and I've enjoyed learning about the front end programming in this program. I can't wait to use my acquired knowledge in a workplace.
